 Automatically compile for .NET (or other) and make a release on github.
## Using it
 Just use this template or copy â€Ž`.github/workflows/publish.yml` (main branch) to your repository. If the "include all branches" option isn't disabled this page will also be copied.
## Troubleshooting
 If you get an error you might be using other branch name, a bad setting for github actions permissions, or a repository with more than one solution/project (specify it on the publish.yml build command).
