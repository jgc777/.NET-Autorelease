# .NET Auto Build and Release (Github Actions)
 Automatically compile and make a release on github.
## Using it
 Just use this template or copy â€Ž`.github/workflows/publish.yml` to your repository. If you get an error you might be using other branch name, a bad setting, or a repository with more than one solution/project (specify it on the file). You might wwant to remove the `_config.yml` and `README.md`
